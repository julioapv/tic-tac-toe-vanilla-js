# TIC TAC TOE VANILLA JS TERMINAL

This is a very simple implementation of the classic game, what's special about it is the use of factory functions and IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to prevent pollution of the global scope.

Still, understading these new concepts is a challenge for me so I will continue to practice to improve what I can build using these design patterns.
